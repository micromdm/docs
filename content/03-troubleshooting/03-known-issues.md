# DEP & MDM Testing + Troubleshooting

## Force DEP check in

This command will force a machine to check up on its DEP configuration record, display configuration contents, and prompt user to enroll in MDM if the machine currently isn't. 

```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/mdmclient dep nag
```

## Check if a machine was enrolled via DEP (10.13+)

This command will display 'An enrollment profile is currently installed on this system' on a device if it was enrolled via DEP. Enrolling via methods other than DEP in 10.13.2 and beyond require manual user approval for complete MDM capabilities.

```bash
/usr/bin/profiles status -type enrollment
```

## DEP & MDM Debug Logging

Enable MDM debug logging

For macOS 10.12+ use this configuration profile: https://gist.github.com/opragel/2b9c518f9a27dce787ed45da832708e2

For OS X 10.11 and below, use the following commands to enable MDM debug logging:

```bash
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.MCXDebug debugOutput -2
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.MCXDebug collateLogs 1
sudo touch /var/db/MDM_EnableDebug
```

Logs of interest:

```bash
/Library/Logs/ManagedClient/ManagedClient.log
/var/log/commerce.log
```

Stream relevant logs on macOS 10.12+:

```bash
log stream --info --debug --predicate 'subsystem contains "com.apple.ManagedClient.cloudconfigurationd"'
log stream --info --debug --predicate 'processImagePath contains "mdmclient" OR processImagePath contains "storedownloadd"'
```

## Re-enroll a DEP Mac without having to wipe the device

10.13 (Warning, this method is unsupported by Apple. Ensure you do not depend on it for production workflows.)

https://gist.github.com/opragel/12555098f5894267c3aba2a7c023a823

10.12

```bash
# Remove indicator that setup assistant has already run
sudo rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone
# Clear all configuration profiles off machine (not entirely clean)
sudo rm -rf /var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/
# Remove Apple Push Notification service daemon keychain
sudo rm /Library/Keychains/apsd.keychain
# Reboot the machine. It should bring you back to setup assistant
# where you can re-enroll using DEP.
```

# Setup Assistant

## Run Setup Assistant as an app in regular user space

```bash
sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/Setup\ Assistant.app/Contents/MacOS/Setup\ Assistant -MBDebug
```

## Setup Assistant Troubleshooting

* Press Command + Option + Control + T during Setup Assistant to open Terminal.
* Press Command + Option + Control + C during Setup Assistant to open Console.
