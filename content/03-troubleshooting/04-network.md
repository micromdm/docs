To use Apple Push Notification service (APNs), your clients need a direct and persistent connection to Apple's servers.

MicroMDM uses the HTTP/2 API for APNs, which may differ from other vendor implementations.

## Clients
Allow outbound connections to Apple’s 17.0.0.0/8 block, over TCP port 2195, 2196, 5223, and 443.

## MDM Server
Allow outbound connections to Apple’s 17.0.0.0/8 block over TCP 443.
